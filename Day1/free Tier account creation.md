## Concepts Simplified

### What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing means renting servers, databases, storage, and other services over the internet instead of owning them.

In simple words:  
> "You pay only for what you use. No upfront investment, no maintenance headache."

**Cloud providers**: Google Cloud (GCP), Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure

### Traditional IT vs Cloud

| Traditional IT                | Cloud (GCP)                       |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Buy servers upfront           | Rent what you need                |
| Pay for peak capacity         | Auto-scale as needed              |
| Manual setup                  | Automated provisioning            |
| High maintenance              | Managed by Google                 |
