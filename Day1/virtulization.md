- Working of Virtualization
  Virtualizations uses special software known as hypervisor, to create many virtual computers (cloud instances) on one physical computer.      The   Virtual Machines behave like actual computers but use the same physical machine.

- Hypervisors
  A hypervisor is the software that gets virtualization to work. It serves as an intermediary between the physical computer and the virtual   machines. The hypervisor controls the virtual machines' use of the physical resources (such as the CPU and memory) of the host computer.
